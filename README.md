## 🎙️ Getting the Best Voice Quality

The app uses your browser's built-in text-to-speech voices. For the best experience:

### macOS Users
1. Go to **System Settings → Accessibility → Spoken Content**
2. Click the **(i)** next to "System voice"
3. Select **"Manage Voices..."**
4. Download any voice marked "Enhanced" or "Siri" (e.g., "Samantha Enhanced")
5. Restart your browser and refresh the app

### Windows Users
- High-quality voices are built into Windows 10/11
- "Microsoft Zira" and "Microsoft David" work great

### Chrome/Brave Users
- "Google US English" and "Google UK English" are excellent choices

## 💡 Why I Built This

I was tired of paying $139/year for Speechify when all I needed was a simple way to listen to articles and PDFs. The browser already has great text-to-speech built in — so I built a nice interface around it.

**Save your money. Use this instead.** 💰
